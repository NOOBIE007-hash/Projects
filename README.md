This is a multiuser Chat system, where many users can join a room of thier choice, and start talking to the members present in that group. This will happen instantly with the
help of web sockets concept, implemented using node, express and javascript. This can be scaled to greater heights by implementing user login using authentication feautures.
Primary focus of this project is to become familiar with web programming and to understand how socket programming works and the role of a server and client.
Frontend was done using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript as this part was not the main focus of this project. Could have used react for the frontend for much more aesthetic 
and fast experience.
